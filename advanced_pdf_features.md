### 2. Component Availability Highlighting

- **Unavailable Components**: Highlight components that are no longer available with specific colors/patterns
- **Backorder Components**: Use different colors/patterns for components on backorder
- **Custom Build Components**: Identify components that need to be built from scratch
- **Module Linking**: Highlight components that require linking multiple modules/circuits

### 3. 3D Model Generation

- **Multi-angle View Processing**: Extract and process component views from different angles
- **Footprint Generation**: Automatically generate KiCad footprints from specification sheets
