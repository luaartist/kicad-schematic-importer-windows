# Creating an Icon for KiCad Plugin

To create an icon for your KiCad plugin, you need to:

1. Create a PNG file named "icon.png" in this directory (resources/)
2. The icon should be 24x24 or 32x32 pixels in size
3. The icon should be simple and recognizable

You can use any image editing software to create the icon, such as:
- GIMP
- Inkscape
- Photoshop
- Paint.NET

Once you have created the icon, place it in this directory and reinstall the plugin:
```
python install.py --kicad-version 9.0
```

Then restart KiCad completely.
