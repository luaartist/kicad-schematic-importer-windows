# Development Roadmap

## Current Version: v0.3.2-alpha

### Completed Features
- ✅ Basic KiCad project structure creation
- ✅ Image import and preprocessing
- ✅ Local component detection with basic heuristics
- ✅ Multi-version KiCad compatibility framework
- ✅ Home Automation Project Manager integration
- ✅ Safety disclaimers and warnings

### In Progress (Current Sprint)
- 🔄 FLUX.AI integration for enhanced component recognition
- 🔄 Community collaboration tools
- 🔄 Component value extraction from images
- 🔄 Connection tracing between components
- 🔄 Testing framework for multi-version compatibility

### Upcoming Features
- 📅 Netlist generation from detected components and connections
- 📅 Hierarchical sheet support
- 📅 Mobile app for capturing schematics
- 📅 Enhanced MQTT integration for home automation
- 📅 User-trainable component recognition

### Known Issues
- ⚠️ Component placement may be offset in some KiCad versions
- ⚠️ Limited accuracy with hand-drawn schematics
- ⚠️ GitHub integration requires additional security testing
- ⚠️ FLUX.AI integration occasionally times out
