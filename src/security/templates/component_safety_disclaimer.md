# Component Identification Safety Disclaimer

## Important Safety Notice

The component identified as `{{component_type}}` with value `{{component_value}}` has been classified with a confidence level of `{{confidence_level}}%`. 

**PLEASE READ CAREFULLY:**

1. **Verification Required**: This identification is provided as a starting point only. You MUST verify this component using appropriate test equipment before using it in any circuit.

2. **Unreadable Markings Warning**: Components with damaged, worn, or unreadable markings have a significantly higher risk of misidentification.

3. **Testing Procedures**:
   - For resistors: Use a multimeter to measure resistance
   - For capacitors: Use an LCR meter or capacitance tester
   - For ICs: Verify pinouts with datasheets and logic analyzers
   - For diodes/transistors: Use component testers or curve tracers

4. **Safety Precautions**:
   - Always disconnect power before replacing components
   - Use appropriate ESD protection
   - Consider using current-limiting devices during initial testing
   - Have appropriate fire safety equipment nearby

5. **Liability Limitation**: This identification is provided "AS IS" without warranty of any kind. The user assumes all risks associated with using this information.

By proceeding with this component identification, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agree to these terms.
