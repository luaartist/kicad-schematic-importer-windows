# Component Replacement Safety Disclaimer

## Critical Safety Warning for PCB Repair

When replacing components on printed circuit boards (PCBs), please acknowledge the following risks:

### Physical Damage Risks
- **Trace Damage (90% Risk)**: There is approximately a 90% chance of damaging PCB traces when removing components, especially with improper tools or techniques
- **Pad Lifting**: Excessive heat or force can lift or separate pads from the PCB
- **Adjacent Component Damage**: Nearby components may be damaged by heat, solder splatter, or physical contact

### Identification Limitations
- **AI Assistance Limitations**: AI tools (including this software) cannot:
  - Physically remove components
  - Assess the condition of your specific board
  - Guarantee component identification accuracy
  - Determine if traces are already damaged
  - Evaluate solder joint quality

### Best Practices
- **Macro Photography**: Always use high-quality macro photography when submitting images for component identification
- **Multiple Angles**: Provide multiple angles of components when possible
- **Include Reference Points**: Include known components in images for scale and reference
- **Document Before Removal**: Photograph components before removal to preserve orientation information

### User Responsibility Acknowledgment
By proceeding with component replacement based on information from this tool, you acknowledge that:

1. You accept full responsibility for any damage to your equipment
2. You will verify all component identifications independently
3. You understand that cross-referencing to standard schematics requires additional verification
4. You will perform proper electrical testing before applying power
5. You have the appropriate skills and equipment for the repair

## Recommended Equipment
- Temperature-controlled soldering station
- Hot air rework station for SMD components
- Flux and appropriate solder
- Solder wick/desoldering pump
- Multimeter for continuity testing
- Magnification equipment
