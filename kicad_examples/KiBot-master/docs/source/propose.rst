   single: complex projects

Proposed advanced KiCad usage
-----------------------------

This section contains some proposed solutions for special, or advanced,

KiCad usage.

.. index::
   single: multiple PCBs

One circuit and more than one PCB implementation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Use hierarchical pages to share the circuit between two projects:
`example <https://github.com/INTI-CMNB/KiBot/tree/dev/docs/1_SCH_2_diff_PCBs>`__

System with more than one PCB
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This case is `discussed here <https://github.com/INTI-CMNB/KiBot/tree/dev/docs/1_SCH_2_part_PCBs>`__
