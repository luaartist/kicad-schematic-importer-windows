Filters and variants
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The filters and variants are mechanisms used to modify the circuit
components. Both concepts are closely related. In fact variants can use
filters.

The current implementation of the filters allow to exclude components
from some of the processing stages. The most common use is to exclude
them from some output. You can also change components fields/properties
and also the 3D model.

Variants are currently used to create *assembly variants*. This concept
is used to manufacture one PCB used for various products. You can learn
more about KiBot variants on the following `example
repo <https://inti-cmnb.github.io/kibot_variants_arduprog/>`__. The
example is currently using KiCad 6, if you want to see the example files
for KiCad 5 go
`here <https://github.com/INTI-CMNB/kibot_variants_arduprog/tree/KiCad5/>`__.

As mentioned above the current use of filters is to mark some
components. Mainly to exclude them, but also to mark them as special.
This is the case of *do not change* components in the BoM.

Filters and variants are defined in separated sections. A filter section
looks like this:

.. code:: yaml

   filters:
    - name: 'a_short_name'
      type: 'generic'
      comment: 'A description'
      # Filter options

filters functionality.

Built-in filters
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  **_datasheet_link** converts Datasheet fields containing URLs into
   HTML links
-  **_expand_text_vars** is a default ``expand_text_vars`` filter
-  **_kibom_dnc_Config** it uses the internal ``dnc_list`` to exclude
   components with

   -  Value matching any of the keys
   -  Any of the keys in the ``Config`` field (comma or space separated)

-  **_kibom_dnf_Config** it uses the internal ``dnf_list`` to exclude
   components with

   -  Value matching any of the keys
   -  Any of the keys in the ``Config`` field (comma or space separated)

-  **_kicost_dnp** used emulate the way KiCost handles the ``dnp``
   field.

   -  If the field is 0 the component is included, otherwise excluded.

-  **_kicost_rename** is a ``field_rename`` filter that applies KiCost
   renamings.

   -  Includes all ``manf#`` and ``manf`` variations supported by KiCost
   -  Includes all distributor part number variations supported by
      KiCost
   -  ‘version’ → ‘variant’
   -  ‘nopop’ → ‘dnp’
   -  ‘description’ → ‘desc’
   -  ‘pdf’ → ‘datasheet’

-  **_mechanical** is used to exclude:

   -  References that start with #
   -  Virtual components
   -  References that match: ’^TP[0-9]*’ or ‘^FID’
   -  Part names that match: ‘regex’: ‘mount.\ *hole’ or
      ’solder.*\ bridge’ or ‘solder.\ *jump’ or ’test.*\ point’
   -  Footprints that match: ‘test.\ *point’ or ’mount.*\ hole’ or
      ‘fiducial’

-  **_none** does nothing, useful when you want to remove a filter
   with default value, but you want to keep the filters processing.
   Can be used in a filter chain.
   Note that an empty name will also create a **_none** filter
-  **_null** does nothing, useful when you want to remove a filter
   with default value, but you don't want to keep the filters processing.
   Can't be used in a filter chain.
   Note that inside a variant the filters processing will be triggered anyways,
   by the variant itself, but **_null** is faster than **_none**
-  **_only_smd** is used to get only SMD parts
-  **_only_tht** is used to get only THT parts
-  **_only_virtual** is used to get only virtual parts
-  **_rot_footprint** is a default ``rot_footprint`` filter
-  **_rot_footprint_jlcpcb** is a ``rot_footprint`` filter with option specific for JLCPCB
-  **_value_split** splits the Value field but the field remains and
   the extra data is not visible
-  **_value_split_replace** splits the Value field and replaces it
-  **_var_rename** is a default ``var_rename`` filter
-  **_var_rename_kicost** is a default ``var_rename_kicost`` filter

Note that the **kibom\ …** filters uses a field named ``Config``, but
you can customise them invoking **_kibom_dnf_FIELD**. This will
create an equivalent filter, but using the indicated **FIELD**.

   pair: 3D models; change with variant simple

Changing the 3D model, simple mechanism
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This mechanism allows small changes to the 3D model. Is simple to use,
but the information is located in the schematic.

If a component defines the field ``_3D_model`` then its value will
replace the 3D model. You can use ``var_rename`` or
``var_rename_kicost`` filter to define this field only for certain
variants. In this way you can change the 3D model according to the
component variant.

When the component has more than one 3D model you must provide a comma
separated list of models to replace the current models.


.. index::
   pair: 3D models; change with variant complex

Changing the 3D model, complex mechanism
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When the a component has a long list of 3D models and you want to keep
all the information in the PCB you can use this mechanism.

The information is stored in the ``Text items`` of the footprint. If you
want to change the 3D models for certain variant you must add an item
containing:

::

   %VARIANT_NAME:SLOT1,SLOT2,SLOTN%

Where ``VARIANT_NAME`` is the name of the variant that will change the
list of 3D models. The ``SLOT1,SLOT2,SLOTN`` is a comma separated list
of 3D model positions in the list of 3D models. All the slots listed
will be enabled, the rest will be disabled.

Here is an
`example <https://github.com/INTI-CMNB/KiBot/tree/master/docs/samples/3D_Model_LCD>`__.
In this example we have a display whose aspect and connectio can
radically change according to the variant. We have two variants:

-  ``left``, uses a ERM1602DNS-2.1 with a connector on the left and two
   other pins on the right
-  ``top``, uses a WH1602B-TMI-JT# with a single connector on the top

We have the following list of 3D models:

::

   ${KISYS3DMOD}/Connector_PinHeader_2.54mm.3dshapes/PinHeader_2x07_P2.54mm_Vertical.wrl
   ${KISYS3DMOD}/Connector_PinHeader_2.54mm.3dshapes/PinHeader_1x16_P2.54mm_Vertical.wrl
   ${KISYS3DMOD}/Connector_PinHeader_2.54mm.3dshapes/PinHeader_1x01_P2.54mm_Vertical.wrl
   ${KISYS3DMOD}/Connector_PinHeader_2.54mm.3dshapes/PinHeader_1x01_P2.54mm_Vertical.wrl
   ${KIPRJMOD}/steps/WH1602B-TMI-JT#.step
   ${KIPRJMOD}/steps/ERM1602DNS-2.1.step

The ERM1602DNS-2.1 uses slots 1, 3, 4 and 6. So the effective list will
be:

::

   ${KISYS3DMOD}/Connector_PinHeader_2.54mm.3dshapes/PinHeader_2x07_P2.54mm_Vertical.wrl
   ${KISYS3DMOD}/Connector_PinHeader_2.54mm.3dshapes/PinHeader_1x01_P2.54mm_Vertical.wrl
   ${KISYS3DMOD}/Connector_PinHeader_2.54mm.3dshapes/PinHeader_1x01_P2.54mm_Vertical.wrl
   ${KIPRJMOD}/steps/ERM1602DNS-2.1.step

The WH1602B-TMI-JT# uses slots 2 and 5. So the effective list will be:

::

   ${KISYS3DMOD}/Connector_PinHeader_2.54mm.3dshapes/PinHeader_1x16_P2.54mm_Vertical.wrl
   ${KIPRJMOD}/steps/WH1602B-TMI-JT#.step

To achieve it we define the following texts in the footprint:
``%left:1,3,4,6%`` and ``%top:2,5%``. Here are both variants:

.. figure:: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/INTI-CMNB/KiBot/master/docs/samples/3D_Model_LCD/output/lcd-3D_top_variant_left.png
   :alt: Left variant

   Left variant

.. figure:: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/INTI-CMNB/KiBot/master/docs/samples/3D_Model_LCD/output/lcd-3D_top_variant_top.png
   :alt: Top variant

   Top variant

If you preffer to use the variant specific matching mechanism you can
use the following syntax:

::

   $TEXT_TO_MATCH:SLOT1,SLOT2,SLOTN$

In this case the variant will be applied to the ``TEXT_TO_MATCH``, if it
matches (equivalent to a component fitted) the ``SLOT`` will be used.

Some important notes:

-  If you want to control what models are used when
   no variant is used you’ll need to create a ``default`` variant. This is
   what the above example does. In this case the ``default`` variant shows
   all the connectors, but no display. Note that changing the 3D model
   needs the variants infrastructure.
-  If you are using variants and a lot of them select the same slots you can
   add a special text: ``%_default_:SLOTS%``. This will be used if none
   ``%VARIANT_NAME:SLOT%`` matched.
-  If you want to disable a model and avoid any kind of warning add
   ``_Disabled_by_KiBot`` to the 3D model path.
   This could be needed if you want to remove some model and you don't want to
   adjust the slot numbers.
-  This mechanism can be used with any of the available variants.
   For this reason we use the ``VARIANT_NAME`` and we avoid relying on any
   variant specific mechanism. But you can use the alternative syntax if you
   preffer the variant specific matching system.

- dnp
