The *outputs* section
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In this section you put all the things that you want to generate. This
section contains one or more **outputs**. Each output contain the
following data:

-  ``name`` a name so you can easily identify it.
-  ``comment`` a short description of this output.
-  ``type`` selects which type of output will be generated. Examples are
   *gerbers*, *drill files* and *pick & place files*
-  ``dir`` is the directory where this output will be stored.
-  ``extends`` used to use another output’s ``options`` as base.
-  ``run_by_default`` indicates this output will be created when no
   specific outputs are requested.
-  ``disable_run_by_default`` can be used to disable the
   ``run_by_default`` status of other output.
-  ``output_id`` text to use for the %I expansion content.
-  ``options`` contains one or more options to configure this output.
-  ``layers`` a list of layers used for this output. Not all outputs
   needs this subsection.

**Important note about the layers**: In the original
`kiplot <https://github.com/johnbeard/kiplot>`__ (from `John
Beard <https://github.com/johnbeard>`__) the name of the inner layers
was *Inner.N* where *N* is the number of the layer, i.e. *Inner.1* is
the first inner layer. This format is supported for compatibility. Note
that this generated a lot of confusion because the default KiCad name
for the first inner layer is *In1.Cu*. People filled issues and
submitted pull-requests to fix it, thinking that inner layers weren’t
supported. Currently KiCad allows renaming these layers, so this version
of kiplot supports the name used in KiCad. Just use the same name you
see in the user interface.

.. index::
   pair: example; gerber

.. code:: yaml

   kibot:
     version: 1

   preflight:
     run_drc: true

   outputs:

     - name: 'gerbers'
       comment: "Gerbers for the board house"
       type: gerber
       dir: gerberdir
       options:
         # generic layer options
         exclude_edge_layer: false
         exclude_pads_from_silkscreen: false
         plot_sheet_reference: false
         plot_footprint_refs: true
         plot_footprint_values: true
         force_plot_invisible_refs_vals: false
         tent_vias: true
         line_width: 0.15

         # gerber options
         use_aux_axis_as_origin: false
         subtract_mask_from_silk: true
         use_protel_extensions: false
         gerber_precision: 4.5
         create_gerber_job_file: true
         use_gerber_x2_attributes: true
         use_gerber_net_attributes: false

       layers:
         - 'F.Cu'
         - 'B.Cu'

Most options are the same you’ll find in the KiCad dialogs.

Outputs are generated in the order they are declared in the YAML file.
To create them in an arbitrary order use the ``--cli-order`` command
line option and they will be created in the order specified in the
command line.


.. index::
   pair: configuration; PCB layers
   pair: outputs; PCB layers

Specifying the layers
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You have various ways to specify the layers. If you need to specify just
one layer you can just use its name:

.. code:: yaml

       layers: 'F.Cu'

If you want to specify all the available layers:

.. code:: yaml

       layers: 'all'

You can also select the layers you want in KiCad (using File, Plot
dialog) and save your PCB. Then you just need to use:

.. code:: yaml

       layers: 'selected'

You can also use any of the following grup of layers:

-  **copper** all the copper layers
-  **technical** all the technical layers (silk sreen, solder mask,
   paste, adhesive, etc.)
-  **user** all the user layers (draw, comments, eco, margin, edge cuts,
   etc.)
-  **inners** all the inner copper layers
-  **outers** all the outer copper layers

You can also mix the above definitions using a list:

.. code:: yaml

       layers:
         - 'copper'
         - 'Dwgs.User'

This will select all the copper layers and the user drawings. Note that
the above mentioned options will use file name suffixes and descriptions
selected automatically. If you want to use a particular suffix and
provide better descriptions you can use the following format:

.. code:: yaml

       layers:
         - layer: 'F.Cu'
           suffix: 'F_Cu'
           description: 'Front copper'
         - layer: 'B.Cu'
           suffix: 'B_Cu'
           description: 'Bottom copper'

You can also mix the styles:

.. code:: yaml

       layers:
         - 'copper'
         - layer: 'Cmts.User'
           suffix: 'Cmts_User'
           description: 'User comments'
         - 'Dwgs.User'

If you need to use the same list of layers for various outputs you can
use YAML anchors. The first time you define the list of layers just
assign an anchor, here is an example:

.. code:: yaml

       layers: &copper_and_cmts
         - copper
         - 'Cmts.User'

Next time you need this list just use an alias, like this:

.. code:: yaml

       layers: *copper_and_cmts


.. index::
   pair: configuration; all outputs

.. include:: sup_outputs.rst

.. index::
   pair: Bill of Materials; consolidate
   pair: Bill of Materials; merge
   pair: Bill of Materials; aggregate

Consolidating BoMs
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Some times your project is composed by various boards, other times you
are producing various products at the same time. In both cases you would
want to consolidate the components acquisition in one operation. Of
course you can create individual BoMs for each project in CSV format and
then consolidate them using a spreadsheet editor. But KiBot offers
another option: you create a BoM for your main project and then
aggregate the components from the other projects.

Here is a simple example. Suppose you have three projects: *merge_1*,
*merge_2* and *merge_3*. For the *merge_1* project you could use the
following output:

.. code:: yaml

   kibot:
     version: 1

   outputs:
     - name: 'bom_csv'
       comment: "Bill of Materials in CSV format"
       type: bom
       dir: BoM
       options:
         use_alt: true

Using the ``tests/board_samples/kicad_5/merge_1.sch`` from the git repo
and storing the above example in ``m1.kibot.yaml`` you could run:

.. code:: shell

   src/kibot -c m1.kibot.yaml -e tests/board_samples/kicad_5/merge_1.sch -d test_merge

And get ``test_merge/BoM/merge_1-bom.csv``:

This CSV says you have five components groped in three different types.
They are one 1 nF capacitor, one 10 nF capacitor and three 1 k
resistors. Now lets generate BoMs for the *merge_2* example:

.. code:: shell

   src/kibot -c m1.kibot.yaml -e tests/board_samples/kicad_5/merge_2.sch -d test_merge

We’ll get ``test_merge/BoM/merge_2-bom.csv``:

In this project we have six components from four different types. They
are similar to *merge_1* but now we also have a 10 k resistor. We don’t
need to generate this BoM to consolidate our projects, but is good to
know what we have. And now lets generate BoMs for the *merge_3* example:

.. code:: shell

   src/kibot -c m1.kibot.yaml -e tests/board_samples/kicad_5/merge_3.sch -d test_merge

We’ll get ``test_merge/BoM/merge_3-bom.csv``:

This time we also have five components, but from two different types.
They are one 1 k resistor and four 10 k resistors. Now suppose we want
to create 10 boards for *merge_1*, 20 for *merge_2* and 30 for
*merge_3*. We could use the following configuration:

.. code:: yaml

   kibot:
     version: 1

   outputs:
     - name: 'bom_csv'
       comment: "Bill of Materials in CSV format"
       type: bom
       dir: BoM
       options:
         use_alt: true
         number: 10
         aggregate:
           - file: tests/board_samples/kicad_5/merge_2.sch
             number: 20
           - file: tests/board_samples/kicad_5/merge_3.sch
             number: 30

Save it as ``m2.kibot.yaml`` and run:

.. code:: shell

   src/kibot -c m2.kibot.yaml -e tests/board_samples/kicad_5/merge_1.sch -d test_merge_consolidate

The ``test_merge_consolidate/BoM/merge_1-bom.csv`` file will be

You can see that now we have much more stats. They say we have four
different types, thirteen for board sets, a total of 60 boards and 250
components. Then we have individual stats for each project. The
capacitors are easy to interpret, we have 30 1 nF capacitors *merge_1*
project has one and *merge_2* another. As we have 10 *merge_1* and 20
*merge_2* boards this is clear. But looking at the 1 k resistors is
harder. We have 80, three from *merge_1*, one from *merge_2* and another
from *merge_3*. So we have 10\ *3+20*\ 3+30=120, this is clear, but the
BoM says they are R1-R3 R2-R4 R5, which is a little bit confusing. In
this simple example is easy to correlate R1-R3 to *merge_1*, R2-R4 to
*merge_2* and R5 to *merge_1*. For bigger projects this gets harder.
Lets assign an *id* to each project, we’ll use ‘A’ for *merge_1*, ‘B’
for *merge_2* and ‘C’ for *merge_3*:

.. code:: yaml

         number: 10
         ref_id: 'A:'
         aggregate:

Now ``test_merge_consolidate/BoM/merge_1-bom.csv`` will have the

As you can see now we know ``A`` has R1-R3, ``B`` R2-R4 and for ``C`` R5
is the 1k resistor. If we want to compact the ``Source BoM`` column we
just need to enable the ``source_by_id`` option:

.. code:: yaml

   kibot:
     version: 1

   outputs:
     - name: 'bom_csv'
       comment: "Bill of Materials in CSV format"
       type: bom
       dir: BoM
       options:
         use_alt: true
         number: 10
         ref_id: 'A:'
         source_by_id: true
         aggregate:
           - file: tests/board_samples/kicad_5/merge_2.sch
             number: 20
             ref_id: 'B:'
           - file: tests/board_samples/kicad_5/merge_3.sch
             number: 30
             ref_id: 'C:'

And we’ll get:

.. index::
   pair: Bill of Materials; columns internal
   pair: Bill of Materials; special columns

.. _bom_columns:

Columns available for the BoM
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In addition to all the user defined fields you also have the following columns:

-  **References**: The component references.
-  **Description**: The description from the component library (DCM file).
   Note that a user field with the same name has more precedence.
-  **Value**: The value for the component. Affected by the **normalize_values** option.
-  **Footprint**: The name of the footprint, without the library name.
-  **Footprint Lib**: The name of the library for the footprint.
-  **Footprint X**: The X coordinate for the footprint.
-  **Footprint Y**: The Y coordinate for the footprint.
-  **Footprint Rot**: The rotation angle for the footprint.
-  **Footprint Side**: The side of the footprint, *bottom* or *top*.
-  **Footprint Type**: The type of the footprint, can be: *SMD*, *THT* or *VIRTUAL*.
-  **Footprint Type NV**: The type of the footprint, can be: *SMD* or *THT*. Empty if not defined.
   Affected by the **footprint_type_values** option.
-  **Footprint Populate**: If the footprint is populated (soldered) or not, can be: *yes* or *no*.
   Affected by the **footprint_populate_values** option.
-  **Footprint X-Size**: The footprint width, no rotation computed.
-  **Footprint Y-Size**: The footprint height, no rotation computed.
-  **Net Name**: Name of the nets associated with the footprint. Useful for testpoints.
-  **Net Class**: Name of the net classes associated with the footprint. Useful for testpoints.
-  **Part**: The name of the symbol for the component, without the library name.
-  **Part Lib**: The name of the library for the symbol.
-  **Datasheet**: The datasheet from the standard field.
-  **Sheetpath**: The path in the schematic hierarchy for the component.
-  **Row**: The row number in the BoM for this entry.
-  **Status**: The DNF (Do Not Fit) and/or DNC (Do Not Change) status for the component.
-  **Quantity Per PCB**: How many components we use for this row for each PCB.
-  **Build Quantity**: How many components we use for this row for all the PCBs.
-  **Source BoM**: From which BoM/s comes this component/s. This is used when consolidating more than one BoM.

Most of the footprint columns are oriented to the creation of position files using the BoM output,

.. index::
   pair: outputs; extend

Using other output as base for a new one
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you need to define an output that is similar to another, and you want
to avoid copying the options from the former, you can *extend* an
output. To achieve it just specify the name of the base output in the
``extends`` value. Note that this will use the ``options`` of the other
output as base, not other data as the comment.

Also note that you can use `YAML
anchors <https://www.educative.io/blog/advanced-yaml-syntax-cheatsheet#anchors>`__,
but this won’t work if you are importing the base output from other
file.

Additionally you must be aware that extending an output doesn’t disable
the base output. If you need to disable the original output use
``disable_run_by_default`` option.



.. index::
   pair: outputs; groups

.. _grouping-outputs:

Grouping outputs
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Sometimes you want to generate various outputs together. An example
could be the fabrication files, or the documentation for the project.

To explain it we will use an example where you have six outputs. Three
are used for fabrication: ``gerbers``, ``excellon_drill`` and
``position``. Another three are used for documentation: ``SVG``,
``PcbDraw`` and ``PcbDraw2``. The YAML config containing this example
can be found `here <tests/yaml_samples/groups_1.kibot.yaml>`__. If you
need to generate the fabrication outputs you must run:

::

   kibot gerbers excellon_drill position

One mechanism to group the outputs is to create a ``compress`` output
that just includes the outputs you want to group. Here is one example:

.. code:: yaml

     - name: compress_fab
       comment: "Generates a ZIP file with all the fab outputs"
       type: compress
       run_by_default: false
       options:
         files:
           - from_output: gerbers
           - from_output: excellon_drill
           - from_output: position

The ``compress_fab`` output will generate the ``gerbers``,
``excellon_drill`` and ``position`` outputs. Then it will create a ZIP
file containing the files generated by these outputs. The command line
invocation for this is:

::

   kibot compress_fab

Using this mechanism you are forced to create a compressed output. To
avoid it you can use ``groups``. The ``groups`` section is used to
create groups of outputs. Here is the example for fabrication files:

.. code:: yaml

   groups:
     - name: fab
       outputs:
         - gerbers
         - excellon_drill
         - position

So now you can just run:

::

   kibot fab

The ``gerbers``, ``excellon_drill`` and ``position`` outputs will be
generated without the need to generate an extra file. Groups can be
nested, here is an example:

.. code:: yaml

   groups:
     - name: fab
       outputs:
         - gerbers
         - excellon_drill
         - position
     - name: plot
       outputs:
         - SVG
         - PcbDraw
         - PcbDraw2
     - name: fab_svg
       outputs:
         - fab
         - SVG

Here the ``fab_svg`` group will contain ``gerbers``, ``excellon_drill``,
``position`` and ``SVG``.

Groups can be imported from another YAML file.

Avoid naming groups using ``_`` as first character. These names are
reserved for KiBot.
