.. _DiffOptions:


DiffOptions parameters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  **output** :index:`: <pair: output - diff - options; output>` [:ref:`string <string>`] (default: ``'%f-%i%I%v.%x'``) Filename for the output (%i=diff_pcb/diff_sch, %x=pdf). Affected by global options.
-  ``add_link_id`` :index:`: <pair: output - diff - options; add_link_id>` [:ref:`boolean <boolean>`] (default: ``false``) When enabled we create a symlink to the output file with a name that contains the
   git hashes involved in the comparison. If you plan to compress the output don't
   forget to disable the `follow_links` option.
-  ``always_fail_if_missing`` :index:`: <pair: output - diff - options; always_fail_if_missing>` [:ref:`boolean <boolean>`] (default: ``false``) Always fail if the old/new file doesn't exist. Currently we don't fail if they are from a repo.
   So if you refer to a repo point where the file wasn't created KiBot will use an empty file.
   Enabling this option KiBot will report an error.
-  ``cache_dir`` :index:`: <pair: output - diff - options; cache_dir>` [:ref:`string <string>`] (default: ``''``) Directory to cache the intermediate files. Leave it blank to disable the cache.
-  ``color_added`` :index:`: <pair: output - diff - options; color_added>` [:ref:`string <string>`] (default: ``'#00FF00'``) Color used for the added stuff in the '2color' mode.
-  ``color_removed`` :index:`: <pair: output - diff - options; color_removed>` [:ref:`string <string>`] (default: ``'#FF0000'``) Color used for the removed stuff in the '2color' mode.
-  ``copy_instead_of_link`` :index:`: <pair: output - diff - options; copy_instead_of_link>` [:ref:`boolean <boolean>`] (default: ``false``) Modifies the behavior of `add_link_id` to create a copy of the file instead of a
   symlink. Useful for some Windows setups.
-  ``diff_mode`` :index:`: <pair: output - diff - options; diff_mode>` [:ref:`string <string>`] (default: ``'red_green'``) (choices: "red_green", "stats", "2color") In the `red_green` mode added stuff is green and red when removed.
   The `stats` mode is used to measure the amount of difference. In this mode all
   changes are red, but you can abort if the difference is bigger than certain threshold.
   The '2color' mode is like 'red_green', but you can customize the colors.
-  ``dnf_filter`` :index:`: <pair: output - diff - options; dnf_filter>` [:ref:`string <string>` | :ref:`list(string) <list(string)>`] (default: ``'_null'``) Name of the filter to mark components as not fitted.
   A short-cut to use for simple cases where a variant is an overkill.

-  ``force_checkout`` :index:`: <pair: output - diff - options; force_checkout>` [:ref:`boolean <boolean>`] (default: ``false``) When `old_type` and/or `new_type` are `git` KiBot will checkout the indicated point.
   Before doing it KiBot will stash any change. Under some circumstances git could fail
   to do a checkout, even after stashing, this option can workaround the problem.
   Note that using it you could potentially lose modified files. For more information
   read https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1248029/git-pull-error-entry-foo-not-uptodate-cannot-merge.
-  ``fuzz`` :index:`: <pair: output - diff - options; fuzz>` [:ref:`number <number>`] (default: ``5``) (range: 0 to 100) Color tolerance (fuzzyness) for the `stats` mode.
-  ``new`` :index:`: <pair: output - diff - options; new>` [:ref:`string <string>` | :ref:`list(string) <list(string)>`] The file you want to compare. Leave it blank for the current PCB/SCH.
   A list is accepted only for the `multivar` type. Consult the `old` option for more information.
-  ``new_type`` :index:`: <pair: output - diff - options; new_type>` [:ref:`string <string>`] (default: ``'current'``) (choices: "git", "file", "output", "multivar", "current") How to interpret the `new` name. Use `git` for a git hash, branch, etc.
   Use `current` for the currently loaded PCB/Schematic.
   Use `file` for a file name. Use `output` to specify the name of a `pcb_variant`/`sch_variant` output.
   Use `multivar` to compare a set of variants, in this mode `new` is the list of outputs for the variants.
   This is an extension of the `output` mode.
   If `old` is also `multivar` then it becomes the reference, otherwise we compare using pairs of variants.
-  ``old`` :index:`: <pair: output - diff - options; old>` [:ref:`string <string>`] (default: ``'HEAD'``) Reference file. When using git use `HEAD` to refer to the last commit.
   Use `HEAD~` to refer the previous to the last commit.
   As `HEAD` is for the whole repo you can use `KIBOT_LAST-n` to make
   reference to the changes in the PCB/SCH. The `n` value is how many
   changes in the history you want to go back. A 0 is the same as `HEAD`,
   a 1 means the last time the PCB/SCH was changed, etc.
   Use `KIBOT_TAG-n` to search for the last tag skipping `n` tags.

.. note::
      when using the `checkout` GitHub action you just get the
                   last commit. To clone the full repo use `fetch-depth: '0'`. |br|

-  ``old_type`` :index:`: <pair: output - diff - options; old_type>` [:ref:`string <string>`] (default: ``'git'``) (choices: "git", "file", "output", "multivar") How to interpret the `old` name. Use `git` for a git hash, branch, etc.
   Use `file` for a file name. Use `output` to specify the name of a `pcb_variant`/`sch_variant` output.
   Use `multivar` to specify a reference file when `new_type` is also `multivar`.
-  ``only_different`` :index:`: <pair: output - diff - options; only_different>` [:ref:`boolean <boolean>`] (default: ``false``) Only include the pages with differences in the output PDF.
   Note that when no differences are found we get a page saying *No diff*.
-  ``only_first_sch_page`` :index:`: <pair: output - diff - options; only_first_sch_page>` [:ref:`boolean <boolean>`] (default: ``false``) Compare only the main schematic page (root page).
-  ``pcb`` :index:`: <pair: output - diff - options; pcb>` [:ref:`boolean <boolean>`] (default: ``true``) Compare the PCB, otherwise compare the schematic.
-  ``pre_transform`` :index:`: <pair: output - diff - options; pre_transform>` [:ref:`string <string>` | :ref:`list(string) <list(string)>`] (default: ``'_null'``) Name of the filter to transform fields before applying other filters.
   A short-cut to use for simple cases where a variant is an overkill.

-  ``threshold`` :index:`: <pair: output - diff - options; threshold>` [:ref:`number <number>`] (default: ``0``) (range: 0 to 1000000) Error threshold for the `stats` mode, 0 is no error. When specified a
   difference bigger than the indicated value will make the diff fail.
   KiBot will return error level 29 and the diff generation will be aborted.
-  ``use_file_id`` :index:`: <pair: output - diff - options; use_file_id>` [:ref:`boolean <boolean>`] (default: ``false``) When creating the link name of an output file related to a variant use the variant
   `file_id` instead of its name.
-  ``variant`` :index:`: <pair: output - diff - options; variant>` [:ref:`string <string>`] (default: ``''``) Board variant to apply.
-  ``zones`` :index:`: <pair: output - diff - options; zones>` [:ref:`string <string>`] (default: ``'global'``) (choices: "global", "fill", "unfill", "none") How to handle PCB zones. The default is *global* and means that we
   fill zones if the *check_zone_fills* preflight is enabled. The *fill* option always forces
   a refill, *unfill* forces a zone removal and *none* lets the zones unchanged.
   Be careful with the cache when changing this setting.
