Draw Stackup
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Draw the PCB stackup. Needs KiCad 7 or newer.
To specify the position and size of the drawing you can use two methods. |br|
You can specify it using the *pos_x*, *pos_y*, *width*, *height* and *layer* options. |br|
But you can also draw a rectangle in your PCB with the size and layer you want. |br|
Then draw another thing inside the rectangle, select both and create a group
(right mouse button, then Grouping -> Group). Now edit the group and change its name
to *kibot_stackup*. After running this preflight the rectangle will contain the
stackup

   -  **draw_stackup** :index:`: <pair: preflight - draw_stackup; draw_stackup>`  [:ref:`DrawStackupOptions parameters <DrawStackupOptions>`] [:ref:`boolean <boolean>` | :ref:`dict <dict>`] (default: ``false``) Use a boolean for simple cases or fine-tune its behavior.
