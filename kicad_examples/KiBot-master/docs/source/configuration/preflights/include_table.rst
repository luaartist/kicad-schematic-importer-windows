Include Table
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Draws a table in the PCB from data in a CSV generated by an output. Needs KiCad 7 or newer.
To specify the position and size of the drawing you should draw a rectangle in your PCB
with the width and layer you want. |br|
Then draw another thing inside the rectangle, select both and create a group
(right mouse button, then Grouping -> Group). Now edit the group and change its name
to *kibot_table_X* where X should match the name of the output. Consult the
`group_name` option for details. |br|
After running this preflight the rectangle will contain the table with the same name. |br|
Only the width of the table is important, the height will be adjusted. |br|

.. note::
   This preflight assumes that a separated KiBot run generated the outputs
   needed for the tables
..
