kibot (1.8.2-1) stable; urgency=medium

  * Added experimental GUI
  * New preflights:
    - Draw Fancy Stackup: which includes the type of vias used
    - Include Table: used to include CSV tables generated by bom/position
      outputs
  * New global options: `dnp_cross_top_layer` and `dnp_cross_bottom_layer` to
    control the layer where footprints are crossed.
  * New SVG option: `use_aux_axis_as_origin` option
  * Added thickness units to the report templates
  * Added support for undocumented font face and color features in the
    worksheet for the PCB Print.
  * New Panelize option: `copy_vias_on_mask` to workaround KiCad's bug 18991
  * Fixed Sub-PCBs not applied for BoM
  * Fixed Copy Files problems when using from compress and worksheets.
  * Fixed Export Project: problems when downloading KiCad models and trying to
    compress the result.
  * Fixed PcbDraw: problems with 0 ohms THT resistors.
  * Fixed on PCB Print:
    - Allow specifying `repeat_for_layer` with empty `repeat_layers`.
    - Problems with drill marks on KiCad 8.0.4+, which prints them in every
      single layer (even technical ones)
    - When trying to force a WKS and the project didn't define a WKS.
      The "gui" strategy failed to use the specified WKS
  * Fixed on Draw stackup:
     - Segmentation Fault on KiCad 8 when creating a new group
     - Units not applied when creating a new group
  * Fixed in the expansion of internal field names. KiCad expands "VALUE",
    not "Value"

kibot (1.8.0-1) stable; urgency=medium

  * Added experimental Altium PCB conversion
  * Now most places where a field is expected now support `_field_*` to fetch
    the globally defined value.
  * Added check_fields preflight: used to ensure conditions on desired fields
  * Added option to e/drc to force english messages (needed for KiCad 8.0.4)
  * Added `separate_pins` filter: used to create testpoint reports
  * Added `_null` filter, can be used to skip the filters processing
  * Added `use_pcb_fields` global options: allows using fields defined in the
    PCB (and not only in the schematic), enabled by default
  * Added `field_current` global options: to specify the field used for
    current ratings
  * New internal templates Testpoints_by_attr, Testpoints_by_attr_CSV,
    Testpoints_by_attr_HTML, Testpoints_by_value, Testpoints_by_value_CSV and
    Testpoints_by_value_HTML: Used to generate testpoint reports
  * New command line option to also list sub-PCBs found in variants

  * Report: added solder paste usage stats, support for variants and testpoints
    report
  * xDRC: added configurable category
  * Schematic: added support for text boxes inside symbols
  * Worksheet: added support for KiCad 8 bitmaps
  * Position: added support for panels repeating the same component
  * iBoM: fixed `highlight_pin1` option didn't allow the use of the new choices.
  * PCB2Blender_Tools: fixed that transform filters might make it fail.
  * BoM: fixed no color reference when using row colors but not column or kicost
    colors, "0 pico" for "0", use of `lcsc_link` as boolean and user fields for
    components that are only in the PCB not filled.
  * Worksheet: Fixed size of PNGs that specify its PPI resolution.
  * Filters: fixed problems with filters that change fields for components that
    are only in the PCB and the use of '_none' filter in lists of filters and
    _kf()
  * Variants: fixed problems when remove_solder_paste_for_dnp and
    remove_adhesive_for_dnp are both disabled (remove_solder_mask_for_dnp
    wrongly defined) and  problems when using `set_text_variables_before_output`
  * Draw Stackup: fixed dimension always drawn on User.Drawings layer and
    problems when the PCB wasn't loaded by another preflight
  * Update XML: fixed `check_pcb_parity` not usable for KiCad 8, must use the
    `drc` preflight
  * PCB Print: fixed the %ln and %ll substitution when using `repeat_for_layer`
    option
  * Render_3D: bottom side components that doesn't rotate from its center got
    displaced highlight, now fixed
  * QR Lib output and various preflights: might remove DRC exclusions. This is
    a KiCad bug that we must workaround.
  * 3D outputs: temporal .kicad_dru file not removed
  * Generated PCB files: fixed problems with some big structures, like zone
    fills, that could generate huge lines in the generated PCB, not supported
    by KiCad.
  * KiCad 8.0.2: changed the behavior with hidden text, it is computed even for
    operations where it isn't really visible, like plotting a layer where we
    don't have the hidden text. So currently KiBot is experimentally disabling
    the "hidden text layer".
    This is a bug in KiCad (https://gitlab.com/kicad/code/kicad/-/issues/17958)
  * Render 3D: modern versions of Image Magick no longer needs two trim passes
    for auto-crop, so now we default to one and an option enables two
  * Preflights: the definition of preflight plug-ins changed. They are slightly
    different now. Currently they are Optionable and share more in common with
    outputs. If you need assistance to migrate a preflight just open a GitHub
    issue.
  * Outputs: Now all options must declare its default.
  * Global `invalidate_pcb_text_cache`: now it changes the PCB on disk, not
    just on memory. This is needed for external tools like KiKit's panelize.
  * In many cases now we allow empty lists and use some sort of default.
    A warning is issued, but we continue.
    - Layers: now the default for missing layers is all layers.
    - Copy files: Now we don't stop when nothing to copy is specified
    - Layers: now the default for missing layers is all layers.
    - KiKit Present: Missing description is no longer fatal
    - Any PCB Print/PCB Print: Missing pages/layers is no longer fatal
    - Populate: Missing input file is no longer fatal
    - QR Lib: Missing QR definition is no longer fatal (%p %r used)
    - Blender Options outputs: Make a render when no outputs are specified
    - PCB Print: repeat_layers defaults to inners
    - Spec to Field: some simple defaults for the specs (voltage, current, power
      and tolerance)

    3D/2D renderers.
  * Fixed Sch errors are now caught during output runs.
  * Fixed compress: Could make Python ZIP lib crash when adding a dir to
    the zip root.
  * Fixed compress: So it also removes subdirs created by an output when
    using move.
  * Fixed in Copy Files:
    - Problems when no target dir and no WKS.
    - Problems when finding the targets (Makefile, copy files, etc.) before
      generating the outputs (or when moved).
  * Fixed expansion of variables in fields could fail if the KiCad config
    wasn't initialized during BoM generation
  * Changed in filters: When we find a component in the PCB, that is not in
    the schematic, and has a malformed reference, now we inform a warning,
    discard the component and continue.
  * Changed in PcbDraw: Now handles panelized boards much faster. Previous
    code was really slow for panels and the time increased exponentially.

    images when we detect a CI/CD environment. They can be enabled using the
    `--warn-ci-cd` command line option.
  * Now KiRi continue even on corrupted schematics
  * Now we avoid W045 on nameless pads. Assuming they are on purpose and not
    real pads.
  * In BoardView now we skip footprints with no pads (not just REF**)
  * Fixed netlist generation problems with components on the PCB but not in
    schematic.

  * Added `download_lcsc` option to disable LCSC 3D model download
  * Now the preflights has individual directory for the ERC and DRC reports
  * Added support for ${field} expansion in the BoM.

  * Diff output:
    - Added option to un/fill zones before doing the comparison
    - Added a new mode where we can control the colors used for added/removed
  * Now components only in the PCB are now processed
  * Footprints in the QR Lib output are flagged with exclude from BoM and Pos,
    also with no court yard requirements, symbol are excluded from simulation
  * Elecrow, FusionPCB, JLCPCB, PCBWay and P-Ban templates now moves the files
    to the compressed output by default.
  * Quick Start now generates configs only for projects, not separated files.
    This avoids problems for sub-sheets in separated dirs.

    - Board/components not visible for small boards
    - Light type names (extra space)
    - Problems when no point of view was defined
  * Fixed in update_xml with check_pcb_parity enabled:
    - Avoid errors for KiCad 6 using "Exclude from BoM" components.
      This limitation isn't found on KiCad 7.
    - *exclude_from_bom* mismatch on KiCad 7
    - *Sheetfile* mismatch on KiCad 7 when testing from different directory

  * Fixed sub PCB separation using annotation method for some edeges and KiCad
    versions
  * Fixed problems when using NET_NAME(n) for a value
  * Fixed JLCPCB rotations for bottom components (JLCPCB changes it from time
    to time)
  * Fixed in the Copy Files:
    - Warnings when using both, the STEP and WRL model, of the same component
    - Fail to detect 3D models subdirs when running alone
  * Fixed in the QR Lib:
    - When used from the preflight the name of the file changed to the name of
      a temporal, generating problems with the plot outputs, like pcb_print
    - Project options not preserved, i.e. set_text_variables failing
    - Bottom QRs should be mirrored in the Y axis
  * Fixed in the Diff:
    - `current`: didn't apply global variants
    - `current`: didn't honor KiCad native DNP flags, they need a filter
    - Problems when trying to use an already existent worktree

    - Problems with KiCad 6+ files using KiCad 5 names for layers
    - Problems scanning dirs without enough privileges
  * Fixed makefile/compress targets (missing project) for PCB/SCH Variant
  * Fixed problems when creating a colored resistor, but we didn't have a cache
    yet (i.e. no model downloaded) for all 3D outputs

kibot (1.6.3-1) stable; urgency=medium

  * Added OS environment expansion in ${VAR}
  * Now outputs can request to be added to one or more groups
  * PCB text variables cached in the PCB are now reset when the config
    uses `set_text_variables`. This is a complex dilemma of KiCad 6/7
    policy implementation.
  * Added default values for @TAGS@
  * Added parametrizable imports
  * Added `--list-variants` List all available variants
  * Added `--only-names` to make `--list` list only output names
  * Added `--only-pre` to list only the preflights
  * Added `--only-groups` to list only the groups
  * Added `--output-name-first` to list outputs by name, no description
  * Added Global options:
    - `use_os_env_for_expand` to disable OS environment expansion
    - `environment`.`extra_os` to define environment variables
    - `field_voltage` Name/s of the field/s used for the voltage raiting
    - `field_package` Name/s of the field/s used for the package, not footprint
    - `field_temp_coef` Name/s of the field/s used for the temperature
      coefficient
    - `field_power` Name/s of the field/s used for the power raiting
    - `invalidate_pcb_text_cache` controls if we reset the text variables cached
      in the PCB file.
    - `git_diff_strategy` selects how we preserve the current repo state.
  * New filter `value_split` to extract information from the Value field and
    put it in separated fields. I.e. tolerance, voltage, etc.
  * New filter `spec_to_field` to extract information from the distributors
    specs and put in fields. I.e. RoHS status.
  * New `generic` filter options `exclude_not_in_bom` and `exclude_not_on_board`
    to use KiCad 6+ flags.
  * New Internal templates JLCPCB_with_THT and JLCPCB_stencil_with_THT: adding
    THT components.
  * New internal filters:
    - `_value_split` splits the Value field but the field remains and the extra
      data is not visible
    - `_value_split_replace` splits the Value field and replaces it
  * New Internal templates:
    - CheckZoneFill: Used to check if a zone fill operation makes the PCB quite
      different
    - Versions with stencil for Elecrow, FusionPCB, P-Ban and PCBWay.
    - PanelDemo_4x4: Demo for a 4x4 panel.
  * New Render_3D options:
    - `realistic`: can be used to disable the realistic colors and get the
      GUI ones

    - `show_eco`: to see the content of the Eco1.User/Eco2.User layers.
    - `show_adhesive`: to see the content of the *.Adhesive layers.
  * New option for Navigate_Results and Compress: `skip_not_run`: used to skip
    outputs not generated in default runs.
  * New Position option `quote_all`: forces quotes to all values in the CSV output.
  * Now `--list` also lists groups
  * KiCad v6/7 schematic: When saving an schematic the hierarchy is expanded
    only if needed, i.e. value of an instance changed
  * When listing actions: Now you must explicitly ask to configure outputs.
    Otherwise isn't needed. As a result you no longer need to have an SCH/PCB.
    Use `--config-outs` to get the old behavior.
  * Git diff link file name: Now we default to using worktrees instead of stash
    push/pop. As a side effect the names of the git points are chnaged. This is
    because main/master only applies to the main worktree. So the names now refer
    to the closest tag.
  * JLCPCB_stencil: Is now just like JLCPCB. The only difference is the added
    layers.
  * Fixed in the KiCad v6/7 schematic format:
    - Net Class Flags not saved in variants or annotated schematics
    - Repeated UUIDs saved in variants
    - Bitmap scale not saved in variants or annotated schematics
    - `lib_name` attribute not saved in variants or annotated schematics
  * Fixed in Position: Components marked as "Exclude from position files" not
    excluded when only SMD components are selected.
  * Fixed in Diff:
    - KIBOT_TAG with n > 0 skipped n commits, not n tags
    - Details related to the project not applied during a diff involving a
      variant (project not copied)
  * Fixed in Copy files:
    - PCB not loaded if the only action was to copy the 3D models
    - Problems for STEP models when copying models
  * Fixed in Gerber: Problems trying to compress gerbers for a board with inner
    layers when using legacy file extensions
  * Fixed in Electro-grammar: Problems with floating point tolerances (i.e. 0.1%)
  * Fixed the KiCad user template directory autodetection for KiCad 7+
