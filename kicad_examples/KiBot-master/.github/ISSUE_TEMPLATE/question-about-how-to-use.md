**What do you want to achieve?**
Describe the result you want to get with as much detail as possible.

**Do you have some PCB/Schematic to use as example?**
A small example can be attached, no need to attach a whole project. To attach files put them inside a .ZIP.
If you are working on a public repo a link to the project is ok.

**Do you have some configuration file (.kibot.yaml) that you are using?**
You can attach it or paste the content in the following section:
```yaml
Paste YAML example here
```

**Environment (please complete the following information):**
Where are you running KiBot:

- Using a docker image? (Ex: `kicad_auto:ki6`, `kicad_auto:latest`, `kicad_auto:dev`, `kicad_auto:dev_k6`, a custom one? can you provide the `Dockerfile`)
