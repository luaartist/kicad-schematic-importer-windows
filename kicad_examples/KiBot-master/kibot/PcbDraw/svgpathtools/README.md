# SVGPathTools 1.4.1
License: MIT
Author: Andy A. Port

## Why?

PcbDraw needs it to compute the full bounding box of the SVG.
But it needs exactly v1.4.1.

- This module isn't popular (not found on Debian)
- Installing v1.4.1 could break other programs

## Code that we don't really need

- paths2svg.py
- smoothing.py
- svg_io_sax.py
